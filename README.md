# Basic EDA and Data Cleaning

This repository contains projects focused on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning on real-world datasets. These projects demonstrate key skills in understanding data, handling missing values, identifying outliers, and standardizing features for analysis or machine learning.
